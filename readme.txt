LICENSE AGREEMENT:


You must agree to abide by the following terms before using Dwarf Fortress:

(1)  This software is still under development and is distributed "as is" with NO warranty of any kind.  Tarn Adams is NOT responsible for any damage done to your system due to use of Dwarf Fortress.

(2)  Tarn Adams is NOT responsible for any offense you might take at the content of Dwarf Fortress.  You agree that Dwarf Fortress meets the standards of your community to the best of your understanding.  You assume full responsibility for any legal issues that might arise involving the use of Dwarf Fortress in your locality.  You understand and accept that Dwarf Fortress contains depictions of violence and insensitive comments.

(3)  You may NOT modify any files, except the files in these folders:

	"raw/objects"
	"data/art"
	"data/init"
	"data/interface"
	"data/movies"
	"data/sound"
	"data/speech"
	
	readme.txt may only be modified in the way described in (4).

(4)  You may distribute Dwarf Fortress, but if you make any modifications you must include a list of these modifications at the end of this file under the existing "MODIFICATIONS" heading.  You must credit yourself (using either your real name or an alias) for any modifications that you made personally, and you must credit the source of any other modifications.  This readme file may NOT be modified in any other way.  Distributions with modifications must obey the rules set out in (3).  You may distribute modified files from the folders listed in (3) without the EXE.  Dwarf Fortress may be bundled with magazine CDs or in other such game collections, but keep in mind that it is currently an alpha and has an alpha notice in big yellow letters on the title page and is probably unstable.  If you are distributing a copy of Dwarf Fortress you received from somewhere else, it is your responsibility to make sure it has the proper modification notifications.  If you cannot verify that the notifications are proper, don't distribute it.

(5)  Aside from nominal fees associated to CD/magazine bundling or other related shipping costs, you may not charge a fee for the distribution of Dwarf Fortress.

(6)  Tarn Adams is NOT responsible for the content of any third-party modifications made to the game files.


Failure to comply with this license agreement may result in legal action.

SUPPORT BAY 12:


Bay 12 Games is fan-supported.  We've put a lot of time and effort into these games, which are all freely distributed, but we can't survive on your feedback alone.  Donations are appreciated.  Visit www.bay12games.com/support.html to see how you can help.

******************************************************

NOTES ON MODIFICATIONS:


Save files will become unusable if any entries are removed.  If you change the configuration of the bodies of existing creatures, save files will become unstable.  New additions to the files are not incorporated into existing regions but will be added to the next world you generate.

You can look at the examples and try your hand at making modifications if you like, but I'm not going to explain how the files are processed here since the format isn't yet stable.  If you have modified the files and the game becomes unstable, don't bother reporting the problem to us, since modifications aren't officially supported yet.  Because modifications are not officially supported at this time, we do not accept submissions for the official Dwarf Fortress releases.  Please do not ask for your art, sound or object files to be incorporated into the official releases.
