SUPPORT BAY 12:


Bay 12 Games is fan-supported.  We've put a lot of time and effort into these games, which are all freely distributed, but we can't survive on your feedback alone.  Donations are appreciated.  Visit www.bay12games.com/support.html to see how you can help.

******************************************************

The license agreement is followed by a rationale below.  Please read that as well.

LICENSE AGREEMENT:

You must agree to abide by the following terms before using Dwarf Fortress:

(1)  This software is still under development and is distributed "as is" with NO warranty of any kind.  Tarn Adams is NOT responsible for any damage done to your system due to use of Dwarf Fortress.

(2)  Tarn Adams is NOT responsible for any offense you might take at the content of Dwarf Fortress.  You agree that Dwarf Fortress meets the standards of your community to the best of your understanding.  You assume full responsibility for any legal issues that might arise involving the use of Dwarf Fortress in your locality.  You understand and accept that Dwarf Fortress contains depictions of violence, demons, potentially disgusting situations, a few words you might not want your children inquiring about, insensitive comments and other potentially objectionable words and concepts.

(3)  You may NOT distribute modified versions of any files, except the files in these folders:

	"raw/objects"
	"raw/graphics"
	"data/art"
	"data/init"
	"data/interface"
	"data/movies"
	"data/save"
	"data/sound"
	"data/speech"
	
	readme.txt may only be modified in the way described in (4).

(4)  You may distribute Dwarf Fortress, but if you make any modifications you must include a list of these modifications at the end of this file under the existing "MODIFICATIONS" heading.  You must credit yourself (using either your real name or an alias) for any modifications that you made personally, and you must credit the source of any other modifications.  This readme file may NOT be modified in any other way.  Distributions with modifications must obey the rules set out in (3).  You may distribute modified files from the folders listed in (3) without the EXE.  Dwarf Fortress may be bundled with magazine CDs or in other such game collections, but keep in mind that it is currently an alpha and has an alpha notice in big yellow letters on the title page and is probably unstable.  If you are distributing a copy of Dwarf Fortress you received from somewhere else, it is your responsibility to make sure it has the proper modification notifications.  If you cannot verify that the notifications are proper, don't distribute it.

(4B)  Distribution of any portion of the source code of Dwarf Fortress is strictly prohibited.  If you reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble Dwarf Fortress in accordance with fair use principles or otherwise obtain any portion of the source code of Dwarf Fortress, you agree to protect it from third parties.  If the source code you reverse-engineered or otherwise obtained comes to be in the possession of a third party by whatever means, you agree to be held liable.

(5)  Aside from nominal fees associated to CD/magazine bundling or other related shipping costs, you may NOT charge a fee for the distribution of Dwarf Fortress.

(6)  Tarn Adams is NOT responsible for the content of any third-party modifications made to the game files.


If any portion of this license is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the license shall remain in full force and effect.


Failure to comply with this license agreement may result in legal action.

******************************************************

LICENSE RATIONALE, in case you care:


(1)  It's an alpha.  It is potentially dangerous to use.

(2)  Once you have a reasonable expectation of what's in a game, it's your responsibility to take care of yourself and those around you.

(3)  Allowing heavily modified EXEs to float around would be suicide for the project, especially if they no longer reference Bay 12 and the people that actually made the game.  It's probably already illegal to do the things I don't want to see happening without adding it to the license, but I thought I'd be clear about it.

(4)  If you make changes, you should mark them down -- people have violated this provision already, and if somebody downloads those bundles, they might think I'm responsible for your additions.  I don't want to take credit or blame for the things other people do.

(4B)  People tinker with stuff, and they are allowed to do that.  However, distribution of the source code will endanger my livelihood, and I've been putting everything I've got into this project.  Don't reverse-engineer DF if you can't keep the code secure.  If you have questions regarding what is permissible, or how I implemented something, contact me at tarn.adams@gmail.com.

(5)  People shouldn't be able to sell the game when I'm not selling it.

(6)  What other people do is not my work or my fault.

CREDITS:


Programming: Tarn Adams

Design: Tarn and Zach Adams

Initial Playtesting: Alan Ames, Alex Mooney, Martin Packman, Ben Ringland and Zonk

Lots of HTML/IT stuff: Martin Packman


Many suggestions from fans on the bay12games.com and other forums (and the #bay12games IRC channel) have been incorporated over the years.

******************************************************

optipng is bundled into the zip for use to change BMPs into PNGs easily, at least until PNG support is added to DF itself.  The license is included in this folder.  You can get the optipng documentation and source at http://optipng.sourceforge.net.  You can use the compress_bitmaps batch file to convert any BMP in the folder to PNG.  The BMP files are deleted afterward.

******************************************************

NOTES ON MODIFICATIONS:


Save files will become unusable if any entries are removed.  If you change the configuration of the bodies of existing creatures, save files may become unstable.  New additions to the files are not incorporated into existing worlds but will be added to the next world you generate.

You can look at the examples and try your hand at making modifications if you like, but I'm not going to explain how the files are processed here since the format isn't yet stable.  If you have modified the files and the game becomes unstable, don't bother reporting the problem to us, since modifications aren't officially supported yet.

We do not accept submissions for the official Dwarf Fortress releases.  Please do not ask for your art, sound or object files to be incorporated into the official releases.
