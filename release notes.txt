TO BACKUP SAVES:

(1) Copy the relevant region folder in "data/save" to a safe location.
(2) When you want to reuse it, copy that region back to "data/save".  Do *NOT* overwrite an old folder, as it might leave residual files.

Please *DO* back up saves.  Although the game has permanent death and you might want to play it in that spirit, the game
is also an alpha, and your world might become corrupted by an error.  You can also make use of the auto save features settable in "data/init/init.txt".



TO USE OLD SAVES WHEN UPDATING VERSIONS:

(0) ***Note that versions numbered 0.27.169.32a+ are not compatible with old versions.***
(1) Unzip the new dwarves into a *NEW* folder.
(2) Copy "data/save" from the old folder into the new folder, or copy over the relevant region folders you've saved to "data/save".  Keep a backup in case something is wrong with the new version.
(3) When you start, your world should be accessible and ready to play.

Unzipping the new dwarves into your old folder will work most of the time, but if files have changed, it can crash, or worse yet, destroy your saves.



TO CHANGE DISPLAY AND SOUND OPTIONS:

Go to "data/init/init.txt".  These options will take effect the next time you start the game.



IF YOUR KEYBOARD ISN'T WORKING:

If you can get to the ESC keybindings menu (from the start screen, press ESC and then 2/8 to scroll to Key Bindings), you can set your key bindings.  If your "?" key on your keyboard doesn't work for help, you can set the keybinding properly here.  It might not display as a "*".  You can set the display up properly in "data/init/interface.txt" using the display strings at the top of the file.

Release notes for 0.27.176.38b:

This is the first Mac release.  Barring some tragic mistake, this is also the last bug fix release before the continuation of the Army Arc.  Again, this release is made up mostly of small changes that people wanted and some bug fixes for the worst problems introducted during the last release.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38a:

Various little things that people have wanted for a while this time, as well as many additional bug fixes.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.173.38a:

The first army arc release, complete with no armies.  It really is mostly foundational work, but you'll notice some small changes here and there, more if you play adventure mode.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33g:

A few more fixes, a few new init options and a new interface for bringing items to the trade depot.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33f:

Various fixes people have been waiting for.  Fixed the farm problem from 33e, goblin sieges, mud tracking, made the treeline less annoying, made the missing gemstones available, and lots of other stuff.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33e:

Continuing along with bug fixing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33d:

Fixed a few of the serious problems (one of the trade crashes, resting injury loops, waterskin filling at wells forever).  See the dev log for other minor changes.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33c:

Continuing along with bug fixing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33b:

Various crash and lag fixes again.  See the dev log for other minor changes.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33a:

Various crash and lag fixes.  There are still lags and crashes, but many of the major offenders have been handled now.  There were also several minor fixes.  See the dev log for those.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.32a:

Well, it has been a while.  That means potential instability, so don't get too attached to your fortresses at this point.  I'll be doing subsequent releases more often now as I solve problems.  In any case, dwarf mode now has a z-axis and you can make fortresses that span several levels.  Fluids behave much more reasonably, and you can walk across the world in adventure mode in the local view without having to step off of an artificial edge.  And various other lots more stuff.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.23.125.23a:

The backbone of temperature is in now, but there's still a lot to do.  I'm not working on it for a while again.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.123.23a:

A bug fix release along with a test-change for the FPS toggling.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.121.23b:

Few more crash bug fixes and several minor changes.

If you are having speed trouble, you can go to init and turn off temperature and weather to see if that's the issue.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.121.23a:

Here are some fixes for crash problems.  I've also added metal bins and more information to the sites in the setup screen.  I fixed the FPS/black space problems with the BMP export options and a few other minor problems as well.

There are still potentially serious problems from the temperature and other recent additions.  I'm going to continue working on bugs for the time being.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.120.23b:

I'm partly through the temperature rewrite.  This release has a lot of bug potential.  You should back up your save folders if you are updating from an older version.

You can set fire to shrubs as an adventurer using the [g] command when you are standing near one.  This is not a permanent command.

The temperature behavior of flows has not been implemented yet.  Very hot/cold creatures do not change the air temperature yet either.  There are a number of features that are in progress regarding temperature.

The problem with dwarves being stuck outside during the stay-inside order should be fixed, as well as a number of other bugs.  You can now move the cursor quickly by using shift + direction.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.120.23a:

Lots of bugs fixed this time around.  I caught a lot of the stay-inside problems, but there are probably some new issues with random jobs now.  I'll fix these as I hear about them.  I'll also correct any additional stay-inside problems as I hear about them.  It should be easier now that more infrastructure is in place.

There's also some creature graphics stuff you can play with.  See "raw/graphics/graphics_example.txt" to mess around with it.  You'll also need to set [GRAPHICS:YES] in "init/init.txt".  I only drew a miner picture, and a blobby dwarf thing, so I don't recommend this unless you are going to draw/use some additional tiles.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23c:

Quick fix for missing color definition problem.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23b:

Quick fix for dyes and a crash bug with inventories in adventure mode.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23a:

There were various cosmetic changes to the game, mainly the addition of dyes and more art images.  The selection of dyes is very limited at present, and only involves ground plants.  There is a new workshop for this in dwarf mode.  You can use blue mushrooms or import other dyes from human traders.  This will be expanded later.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22f:

This release is mainly to handle the issues with specific piles.  There are a few other bug fixes as well.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22e:

Fixed a save corrupting problem.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22d:

Quick patch for a crash bug from saving furniture piles.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22c:

Aside from fixing some crash bugs, the main change this time is the addition of specific pile types.  You can access these from [q] on existing piles or you can set them when you are placing piles by selecting "custom settings".  Piles now make claims on bins and barrels.  This is displayed as "Cedar Bin <#12>".  You can use the [q] view for a pile to set the maximum number of bins and barrels it uses.  For now, a pile will only take one extra empty bin/barrel until something is placed inside, then it will take another until it gets up to the maximum.  We'll add some other options later.  In the [p]ile menu, you can also designate a number of reserved bins and barrels that will be used by jobs such as distillation before any stockpile gets to claim them.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22a:

I fixed a lot of bugs; see the dev list.

The main change for this version was the rewrite of the inventory system.  There will probably be several compat. issues, as well as various horrible bugs.  I've tested and fixed what I've found, but you'll find more.  **Back up your old saves before trying this version**  The old saves will work with this version, but you need to be careful with them.

Those that deserve fingers and toes have them in this version.  You'll also notice right/left gloves.  Creatures lose items now with severs, so you'll lose your left gauntlet if your left arm is removed, for instance.

Creatures are a bit silly about wear they put on rings and other trinkets.  Rings will probably pile up on the right thumb for instance, and earrings will pile up in the right ear.  Armor stands will also only store one glove and one boot for the time being.  This will be sorted out over time.

There aren't any temperature effects despite the residents wearing clothing depending on the average temperature.  This will also be handled later.

Finally, there aren't any gender links to clothing right now, so you might see male dwarves in "dresses" and "skirts".  Keep in mind that men all over the world wear clothing like this, and that's what is meant by these generic terms.  You can remove the items from the entity raw before you play if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.107.21a:

There will be families and guards in new world towns, concluding the first third of the Bustling Town Arc.

There's a wait key in adventure mode now (period), as well as some helpful "are you sure?" prompts.

Various bug fixes -- including the clothing acquirement bug, the shield equipment bug and some ashery bugs.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21c:

I fixed various bugs and implemented other minor changes.  See the changes list for those.  Nobles can still demand items involving small creature bones in old saves, but the preference is no longer generated in new dwarves.

New worlds will see a few cosmetic changes in adventure mode towns (it was not possible to include them in old saves).  It's probably not worth generating a new world for them (and I haven't put up new pregenerated worlds), but the new towns have some larger cookie-cutter buildings like apartment complexes, and everybody will sleep at night and eat three meals a day from a magic barrel in their room that refills at midnight.  Once the caravans and a notion of wealth are in, this can all be differentiated properly instead.  As we progress along the Bustling Town Arc, it'll eventually be worthwhile to regenerate if you play adventure mode, but it's not a big deal right now.  In old worlds, you might notice some things like merchants taking breaks to wander around or sleeping on the beds in the mead hall.  They are just trying their best to follow the new schedules without having a home to go to.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21b:

There's a skeleton of a workshop profile now.  It is in progress and undocumented.  You can select workers to work at the shop either by name or by skill level.  The list is not ordered yet.  You can use the mouse on this screen.  It's also written up in a new way that is independent of the 80x25 window to facilitate some more flexibility later on.

Many small fixes (read the dev log).

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21a:

This fixes a problem with the export feature, lets you play around with the mouse when doing designations and cleans up some of the problems with flows and channel-related spam.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.19c:

Some highlights include fixing the disappearing bone/shell problem and allowing engraved wall images to be toggled on and off.  The detailing jobs shouldn't shut off at random any more.

Some of the issues with cat butchery have been handled.

I did a little bit with consolidating announcments (x2, x3, etc.), but I'll need more time to do it properly.

Alt-tabbing in full screen might work a little better.  Seems to work here is all I can say.

Until I make the cleaners smarter, blood disappears at the beginning of every season now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.19a:

Fixed several crash bugs and cleaned up some affected saves.  I also found out why named creatures were disappearing sometimes and fixed that, though saves in which the problem is currently active will still see some of it.

Chasming refuse is in, though there will probably be some irregularities of which you'll have the pleasure of informing me.

There were some other changes that might help with sheriff/injury tantrums.

Some of the tree designation clearance problems should be gone.

Trade agreements should work properly.

The thieves that enter the fortress are somewhat easier to detect now.

Depending on how you've bound your keys, you should have the odd hold-down behavior only when using a cursor or scrolling now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.102.19a:

Fixed a couple more crashes and various other errors (see the change log).

Genders are mixed on starting animals now and horses should breed.  The unit screen will show some other designations beside "No Job" and there it will distinguish merchants and diplomats.  Water should flow into the cliff face now, at least from new channels.

You can give your units nicknames and profession names now.  Do this from the [vpz] profile using [y] to customize them.  In adventure mode, you do it from the [l]ook + [enter] status view (again [y] to customize).  The [y] command appears onscreen.

Some tantrum issues were fixed.  Placing artifact furniture was actually making them unhappier.  Fist fights and beatings still led to a minor version of the civil war bug.  These issues have been resolved.

The "Shift + R Menu" instead of "n" for the N key has been resolved, though you might need to clean up your old files a bit if you are important old ones.

You can toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode using F11 (or whatever key you bind) whenever you like now.  Let me know what problems come up with this.  I haven't handled direct minimization from fullscreen, but you can toggle and minimize from the windowed mode.  You can also get rid of the "fullscreen?" box that pops up the beginning in "data\init\init.txt" now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19d:

Resolved a unit scrambling issue from active saves in adventure mode.  You will no longer turn into the stray dog in town or a random goblin or warthog.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19c:

Fixed a few more crash problems, but the main thing was to hopefully remove some of the strange mainly adventure mode instability introduced by the last version.  In case this sort of thing persists, please be careful to backup your saves before trying this one.  Worlds that were generated in or even played in the briefly-available 0.21.101.19b are likely to be twisted to pieces, especially if you played adventure mode.


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19b:

Many more crash fixes, including stopping some of those inflate errors.  Those saves are still corrupted though.

I've changed how some of the search routines work.  I tested it out on several saves, but you should keep a copy of yours safe before you try this one just in case, as usual.  If you get around to creating a new world, you'll notice a significant speed increase when the years march up.  Some of this also carries over to the main game.

Finally, aqueduct behavior has been partially repaired.  Building an aqueduct over your chasm should work, but aqueducts over water can randomly drown your fortress.  If you want to get lava over the river, try a stone bridge instead.  If you lava is in a channel next to the bridge, you might need to use a floodgate to get it over.  Bridges over water filled channels probably won't conduct lava properly.  I'll get around to fixing the rest of this in time, but there are still some crash bugs etc. that are higher priority.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19a:

Several crash bugs should be fixed now.  Most saves will be recoverage, unless they have a load inflate error.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.100.19a:

See command_line.txt for information on world generation from command lines.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.95.19c:

Old save farmplots might show "Ft 0/0" for the fertilizer amount.  It will update at the beginning of the season.
