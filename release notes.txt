TO BACKUP SAVES:

(1) Copy your "data\save" folder to a safe location.
(2) When you want to reuse it, first delete the current "data\save" folder, then copy the old one into place.

Do *NOT* copy save folders over other save folders.  This can cause corruption of saves.

Please *DO* back up saves.  Although the game has permanent death and you might want to play it in that spirit, the game
is also an alpha, and your world might become corrupted by an error.



TO USE OLD SAVES WHEN UPDATING VERSIONS:

(1) Unzip the new dwarves into a *NEW* folder.
(2) Copy "data\save" from the old folder into the new folder.  Keep a backup in case something is wrong with the new version.
(3) When you start, your world should be accessible and ready to play.

Unzipping the new dwarves into your old folder will work most of the time, but if files have changed, it can crash, or worse yet, destroy your saves.



TO CHANGE DISPLAY AND SOUND OPTIONS:

Go to "data\init\init.txt".  These options will take effect the next time you start the game.



IF YOUR KEYBOARD ISN'T WORKING:

If you can get to the ESC keybindings menu (from the start screen, press ESC and then 2/8 to scroll to Key Bindings), you can set your key bindings.  If your "?" key on your keyboard doesn't work for help, you can set the keybinding properly here.  It might not display as a "*".  You can set the display up properly in "data\init\interface.txt" using the display strings at the top of the file.

Release notes for 0.21.104.21a:

See the file changes txt for new init/interface information.
Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a full list of changes.

This fixes a problem with the export feature, lets you play around with the mouse when doing designations and cleans up some of the problems with flows and channel-related spam.

Release notes for 0.21.104.19c:

See the file changes txt for new init/interface information.
Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a full list of changes.

Some highlights include fixing the disappearing bone/shell problem and allowing engraved wall images to be toggled on and off.  The detailing jobs shouldn't shut off at random any more.

Some of the issues with cat butchery have been handled.

I did a little bit with consolidating announcments (x2, x3, etc.), but I'll need more time to do it properly.

Alt-tabbing in full screen might work a little better.  Seems to work here is all I can say.

Until I make the cleaners smarter, blood disappears at the beginning of every season now.

Release notes for 0.21.104.19a:

See the file changes txt for new init/interface information.
Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a full list of changes.

Fixed several crash bugs and cleaned up some affected saves.  I also found out why named creatures were disappearing sometimes and fixed that, though saves in which the problem is currently active will still see some of it.

Chasming refuse is in, though there will probably be some irregularities of which you'll have the pleasure of informing me.

There were some other changes that might help with sheriff/injury tantrums.

Some of the tree designation clearance problems should be gone.

Trade agreements should work properly.

The thieves that enter the fortress are somewhat easier to detect now.

Depending on how you've bound your keys, you should have the odd hold-down behavior only when using a cursor or scrolling now.

Release notes for 0.21.102.19a:

See the file changes txt for new init/interface information.
Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a list of changes.

Fixed a couple more crashes and various other errors (see the change log).

Genders are mixed on starting animals now and horses should breed.  The unit screen will show some other designations beside "No Job" and there it will distinguish merchants and diplomats.  Water should flow into the cliff face now, at least from new channels.

You can give your units nicknames and profession names now.  Do this from the [vpz] profile using [y] to customize them.  In adventure mode, you do it from the [l]ook + [enter] status view (again [y] to customize).  The [y] command appears onscreen.

Some tantrum issues were fixed.  Placing artifact furniture was actually making them unhappier.  Fist fights and beatings still led to a minor version of the civil war bug.  These issues have been resolved.

The "Shift + R Menu" instead of "n" for the N key has been resolved, though you might need to clean up your old files a bit if you are important old ones.

You can toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode using F11 (or whatever key you bind) whenever you like now.  Let me know what problems come up with this.  I haven't handled direct minimization from fullscreen, but you can toggle and minimize from the windowed mode.  You can also get rid of the "fullscreen?" box that pops up the beginning in "data\init\init.txt" now.

Release notes for 0.21.101.19d:

Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a list of changes.

Resolved a unit scrambling issue from active saves in adventure mode.  You will no longer turn into the stray dog in town or a random goblin or warthog.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19c:

Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a list of changes.

Fixed a few more crash problems, but the main thing was to hopefully remove some of the strange mainly adventure mode instability introduced by the last version.  In case this sort of thing persists, please be careful to backup your saves before trying this one.  Worlds that were generated in or even played in the briefly-available 0.21.101.19b are likely to be twisted to pieces, especially if you played adventure mode.


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19b:

Go to http://www.bay12games/dwarves/dev_now.html to see a list of changes.

Many more crash fixes, including stopping some of those inflate errors.  Those saves are still corrupted though.

I've changed how some of the search routines work.  I tested it out on several saves, but you should keep a copy of yours safe before you try this one just in case, as usual.  If you get around to creating a new world, you'll notice a significant speed increase when the years march up.  Some of this also carries over to the main game.

Finally, aqueduct behavior has been partially repaired.  Building an aqueduct over your chasm should work, but aqueducts over water can randomly drown your fortress.  If you want to get lava over the river, try a stone bridge instead.  If you lava is in a channel next to the bridge, you might need to use a floodgate to get it over.  Bridges over water filled channels probably won't conduct lava properly.  I'll get around to fixing the rest of this in time, but there are still some crash bugs etc. that are higher priority.
